Tuesday - A completely and utterly boring day, welcome to a day in the average British teen's life... Honestly, I just sit in my boring lessons (One i liked) and sit there and moan until the bell goes, then moan in the next lesson. This happens day in, day out, wait until PE...

Well... Tommorow is very clearly Wednesday,  I have a very boring day again, I have no idea on a schedule, I am thinking Tuesday/Wednesday updates. Meh, I'll think about it. 
Sorry for the brief "Hello" and my next 'blog' post will be 25 facts about me!!

See you soon,
